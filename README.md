# a0-plugins
This repository is the community-maintained index of plugins surfaced in Agent Zero.

Submit a PR here to make your plugin visible to other Agent Zero users.

## What goes in this repo

Each plugin submission is a single folder (unique plugin name) containing:

- **`plugin.yaml`**
- **Optional thumbnail image** (`.png`, `.jpeg`/`.jpg`, or `.webp`)
  - **Square aspect ratio**
  - **Max size: 20 KB**
- **Optional screenshots** in `plugin.yaml` under `screenshots`
  - Up to **5 screenshot URLs**
  - Must be **full URLs**
  - Allowed formats: `.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.webp`
  - URL must exist
  - **Max size: 2 MB per screenshot**

This repository is an index only: `plugin.yaml` points to the plugin's own repository.

## Submitting a plugin (Pull Request)

Every PR is first automatically validated by CI. If it passes, it will then be reviewed by a human maintainer before merging.

If your PR keeps failing checks and has no activity for 7+ days, it may be automatically closed.

### Rules

- **One plugin per PR**
  - Your PR must add exactly **one** new top-level subfolder for your plugin.
- **Unique folder name**
  - Use a unique, stable folder name with lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only (regex: `^[a-z0-9_]+$`).
- **Reserved names**
  - Folders starting with `_` are reserved for project/internal use (examples, templates, etc.) and are **not visible in Agent Zero**. Do not submit community plugins with a leading underscore.
- **Required metadata**
  - All required fields in `plugin.yaml` must be present and non-empty.
- **Optional metadata**
  - The optional fields are **`tags`** and **`screenshots`**.

### Automated validation (CI)

PRs are automatically checked for:

- **Structure**
  - Exactly one plugin folder per PR under `plugins/<your-plugin-name>/`
  - No extra files (only `plugin.yaml` and an optional thumbnail)
- **`plugin.yaml` rules**
  - Only allowed fields: `title`, `description`, `github`, `tags`, `screenshots`
  - Required fields: `title`, `description`, `github`
  - `plugin.yaml` max total length: 2000 characters
  - `title` max length: 50 characters
  - `description` max length: 500 characters
  - `github` must be a GitHub repository URL that exists and contains `plugin.yaml` at the repository root
  - The plugin folder name in this index (for example `plugins/my_plugin/`) must exactly match the `name` field in the remote repository's root `plugin.yaml`
  - `tags` (if present) must be a list of strings, up to 5
  - `screenshots` (if present) must be a list of full image URLs, up to 5
- **Thumbnail rules (optional)**
  - Must be named `thumbnail.<ext>`
  - Must be square and <= 20 KB
  - Allowed formats: `.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.webp`
- **Screenshot rules (optional)**
  - Must be provided only via `plugin.yaml` field `screenshots`
  - Up to 5 URLs total
  - Must be full URLs
  - Allowed formats: `.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.webp`
  - Each URL must exist
  - Max size per file: 2 MB

### Folder structure

```text
plugins/<your_plugin_name>/
  plugin.yaml
  thumbnail.png|thumbnail.jpg|thumbnail.jpeg|thumbnail.webp   (optional)
```

The folder name under `plugins/` is authoritative in this index and must exactly match the `name` in your remote repository's root `plugin.yaml`.

### `plugin.yaml` format

See `plugins/_example1/plugin.yaml` for the reference format.

Required fields:

- **`title`**: Human-readable plugin name
- **`description`**: One-sentence description
- **`github`**: URL of the plugin repository (its root `plugin.yaml` must include a `name` field that exactly matches your folder name in this index: `plugins/<your_plugin_name>/`)

Optional fields:

- **`tags`**: List of tags (recommended list: [`TAGS.md`](./TAGS.md), up to 5 tags)
- **`screenshots`**: List of up to 5 full image URLs (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`), each reachable and <= 2 MB

Screenshot URL tips:

- You can host screenshots in your plugin repository and reference them directly with raw URLs.
- Example raw GitHub URL format:
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/path/to/screenshot.png`
- You can also use any other stable public image URL, as long as it is reachable, uses an allowed extension, and stays within the size limit.

Example:

```yaml
title: Example Plugin
description: Example plugin template to demonstrate the plugin system
github: https://github.com/agentzero/a0-plugin-example
tags:
  - example
  - template
screenshots:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentzero/a0-plugin-example/main/docs/main.png
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentzero/a0-plugin-example/main/docs/settings.webp
```

## Recommended tags

Use tags from [`TAGS.md`](./TAGS.md) where possible (recommended: up to 5 tags):
